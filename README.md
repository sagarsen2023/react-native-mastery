# This project is for understanding purpose
This project I have created by following along with [JS Mastery's React Native Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kmy_YNhl0mw&t=12130s)

My motive to following along this Youtube Video is only:
- Creating an app using expo
- Understanding the updated react native architecture
- Leveling up my knowledge to become a successfull react native developer
